# ChainSentryAI User Guide

Welcome to ChainSentryAI! This guide will walk you through the key features of the application and help you get the most out of your security audits.

## 1. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first page you see upon logging in. It provides a high-level summary of your security posture.

-   **Summary Cards**: At the top, you'll find cards for **Total Audits**, **Total Findings**, and **Critical Findings**. These give you an immediate sense of your overall activity and risk level.
-   **Recent Audits**: This list shows your most recently completed audits. You can quickly access any report by clicking the "View Report" button.
-   **Findings by Severity**: This chart visualizes the distribution of all detected vulnerabilities across different severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational), helping you understand where the greatest risks lie.

## 2. Starting a New Audit

To begin a new security scan, navigate to the **New Audit** page from the sidebar.

1.  **Choose Your Input Method**:
    -   **From GitHub**: Paste the full URL of a public GitHub repository into the input field. The engine will clone and analyze the repository.
    -   **Upload Files**: Drag and drop your `.sol` or `.rs` files into the designated area, or click to open a file selector.

2.  **Select the Target Chain**:
    -   Choose between **Ethereum** (for Solidity contracts) and **Solana** (for Rust/Anchor programs). This ensures the correct analysis tools are used.

3.  **Start the Analysis**:
    -   Click the "Start Hybrid Analysis" button.

## 3. The Audit Process

After starting an audit, you will be taken to the **Audit Progress** screen. This view provides transparency into our powerful hybrid analysis engine. You will see a checklist of stages, such as:
-   Building AST, CFG, and DFG
-   Performing Taint Analysis
-   Bounded Symbolic Execution with Z3
-   Augmenting Results with Gemini AI

The current stage is highlighted, and completed stages are marked with a check. This process can take a few minutes for larger projects.

## 4. Understanding the Audit Report

Once the audit is complete, you will be redirected to the detailed **Audit Report** page.

-   **Severity Summary**: The cards at the top show the breakdown of findings for this specific audit.
-   **Findings List**: On the left, you'll find a list of all detected vulnerabilities, sorted by severity. Click on any finding to view its details on the right.

### Detailed Finding View

When you select a finding, its details are displayed in a tabbed interface:

-   **Explanation Tab**:
    -   **Description**: A clear, concise explanation of the vulnerability.
    -   **AI Analysis**: A more detailed analysis generated by Gemini, explaining the technical root cause and potential impact.
    -   **Metadata**: Includes the **CVSS** score (a universal measure of severity), the associated **SWC ID** (for Ethereum), and our engine's **Confidence** level in the finding.

-   **Vulnerable Code Tab**:
    -   This tab displays a snippet of your source code. The exact lines where the vulnerability was detected are highlighted, allowing you to pinpoint the issue instantly.

-   **AI Suggested Patch Tab**:
    -   A `diff` view shows the recommended changes to fix the vulnerability. Lines to be removed are shown in red (`-`), and lines to be added are shown in green (`+`). This provides a clear, actionable path to remediation.

-   **Trace Graph Tab**:
    -   For certain vulnerability types (like reentrancy or data flow issues), this tab provides a graph that visualizes the flow of data or execution from a controllable source to a dangerous sink.

## 5. Demo Mode

The current version of the application operates in a fully interactive **Demo Mode**. This means all the audits and findings you see are pre-loaded from a sample dataset. This allows you to explore the full functionality of the UI without connecting a wallet or providing real contract code.

## 6. (Future) GitHub Integration & Subscriptions

-   **Create GitHub PR**: In future versions, you will be able to automatically create a GitHub pull request with the AI-suggested patches directly from the report page.
-   **Subscription Plans**: The "Upgrade to Pro" button in the sidebar will unlock unlimited audits, advanced analysis features, and collaborative tools for teams.
